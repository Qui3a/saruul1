            'overview' => "<p>This tour is designed for more comfort by allowing you to fly more and travel less on long, bumpy roads.
<br>Our first destination, Khuvsgul Lake, is one of the most beautiful lakes in Mongolia.  Foreign tourists as well as Mongolians enjoy Mother Nature while horse trekking, sailing, or simply taking a walk on the lake's peaceful shores.  A visit to a reindeer herder family makes this part of the tour even more special.  Reindeer people are one of Mongolia's minority groups.  Visitors will be fascinated as they get to know the people and observe their simple, yet unique lifestyle which has been preserved from generation to generation. Overall, there are approximately 700 deer stones throughout Central Asia and 600 of them exist in Mongolia.  Deer stones that date back to the Bronze Age can be found at another spot in this area called Uushin Uvur. The stones at this site are especially significant because these man stones have facial features and motifs.
<br>  The next destination is the famous Gobi Desert.  We follow the path of legendary American explorer, adventurer, and naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews.  During four expeditions in the Gobi Desert between 1922 and 1925, he discovered the bones of various kinds of dinosaurs as well as a nest of dinosaur eggs.  To the Mongolians he was a “Dragon Hunter,” but to the rest of the world he was a fossil explorer who unearthed the mysteries of the Gobi Desert. Believe it or not, dinosaur bones can still be found there today!
<br> Although the dinosaur findings are the pearl of the Gobi, there is still a lot more to see.  Beautiful Yol Valley is a great place to wind down while searching for ibex, mountain sheep, bearded vultures, and other interesting creatures.  There's also a dramatic gorge that is filled with ice during most of the year.  Don't miss a visit to the fascinating Khongor Sand Dunes which stretch for 100 kilometers.  We'll spend time with a camel herder family and ride to the dunes on Bactrian camels.
<br> You'll be guaranteed to have fun as you climb to the top of the Singing Dunes where you will see breathtaking scenery and hear the sand as it mimics the sound of a plane engine.
<br>  The tour continues to the Orkhon Valley which is significant because all of the ancient empires and powerful nomadic tribes from the Xiongnu to the Great Mongol Empire established their capital cities in this valley.  We will explore Kharkhorin, the ancient capital city of the XIII century Mongol Empire.  It was established in 1220 by the great Chinggis Khan. Kharkhorin prospered during Ugudei's reign, but weakened during the reign of Khubilai.  Although Kharkhorin has remained a small town, it is still major tourist destination and attracts local and foreign tourists with its long history, beautiful landscapes, and historical monuments.  In Kharkhorin, you can visit the Erdene Zuu Monastery.  Constructed in 1580, it is the oldest and largest monastery found in the ruins of the capital city.
<br>  The last, but definitely not the least destination is Hustai National Park where Przewalski horses were re-introduced to their motherland.  It is definitely an unforgettable experience to see these beautiful wild horses grazing peacefully along with roe deer and marmots.
<br> We promise the best service you can get in Mongolia.  If you truly love traveling and exploring in untouched lands, Mongolia must, without a doubt, be at the top of your list!</p>",

There are a few villages along the way, but most of the population are nomadic and live in the traditional round white gers. Depending on how much rain has fallen, wild flowers may be abundant, and there is a good chance of seeing eagles, cranes, vultures, partridge, falcons and other interesting birds along the way.</p>
            <p>The trail is classed as moderate, requiring some technical skill to manage the steep rocky passes. The first couple of days are on hard packed mud tracks through valleys between the mountains. If there is much rain, the surface may be slippery and more difficult. Riding through the forests and over mountains on rocky tracks sometimes blocked by fallen trees will be quite challenging. The daily riding distance is between 40km - 80km, depending on the terrain. </p>",

<br/>
I had an awesome time in Mongolia. I really came on the trip not knowing what to expect and honestly wasn't sure if it would be 'my thing' but you really did make it worth it and it was money well spent.
</p><p>
Thank you for your friendly, fun and professional attitude. We had a blast! Listening to Mongolian music during the drive definitely added to the mood and experience.
The wild horses were amazing and we took so many photos, it was so hard to choose the ones we wanted to print out for our photo album.
</p><p>
I definitely recommend anyone who is up for an adventure, filled with culture and history and a very friendly tour guide- who basically becomes part of the family/group; to go for Travel All Mongolia. You will leave with not only leave with knowledge of the country's hidden treasures and secrets, but also FANTASTIC photos, a HUGE smile and SATISFACTION for your money well spent. seeing this gorgeous land.
</p><p>
Thanks again Soyoloo It was really a great experience and filled with a lifetime of memories.</p>

I had a very enjoyable and unforgettable holiday in Mongolia, as it truly was the holiday of a lifetime. Mongolia is a fantastic destination because the scenery is just beautiful and the people are so friendly. Soyoloo was our tour guide and he spoke very good English, he was always punctual, very helpful and generally took care of us. He had very good knowledge of Mongolia, so we were well informed well of the history of Mongolia, the summer festival Nadaam, the traditional gers in the countryside, and the city of Ulaanbaatar. Visiting the traditional gers with Soyoloo was especially fun because We got to do so many different activities like try archery, try some of the Mongolian food, ride a camel, have our names written in Mongolian and we even had Mongolian music played to us. I had learnt that Mongolia is such a fascinating and unique country, which is extremely picturesque, and we would absolutely love to visit the country again in the future. I would recommend anyone thinking of going to Mongolia through Travel All Mongolia, to absolutely go, and get in contact with Soyoloo, because you will be well looked after and you will never forget the holiday.</p>

And then the desert, the Gobi, the dunes. A strange landscape that makes us running with imagination in geography books. Mongolia is much more: it is a country of dust, sounds, never-ending silence, and endless landscapes, horizons that seem to grow without end and without obstacles. Mongolia is reflected in people's eyes: peaceful, calm, always helpful and kind, fair … almost noble in their attitudes. People who live in gers (a name which will not say anything to most of Italian people) but that indicates typical tents where the nomadic Mongols lived and still live. Without continuous light, no running water, no comfort, no division of rooms and even less without bathroom. A tent where every day at any time you find a thermos full of hot water or airag (fermented milk, with a slightly salty taste and alcohol), ready for guests. A small cluster, a small world open to anyone who passes. No matter whom he is, where he comes from, what language he speaks. Just stop on the road (dusty way, sometimes there is not even a path and the driver moves like following an invisible line in the middle of the landscape). Someone will arrive in the saddle of his horse or riding a motorcycle. Probably it will be a child (they are entrusted to their family’s herds) and he will immediately try to figure out how to help. Because you do not stop in the desert, if you do not really need to. You constantly travel, ride, go. And when you leave Ulaanbaatar (or UB, as they call it) you’ll see just that: a long and vast prairie, always changing. Rockets, desert, dunes, mountains and plains. One day you are in t-shirt with 35 ° C. The day after you are obliged to wear gloves and scarf! Heaven and earth meet and touch (average altitude above sea level is from 1000 meters at least, UB is 1330 meters) ... in some places you believe you can touch the clouds. So it is not surprising to find out that one of the main deities is Tenger, the god of the sky. During night the sky is so beautiful and wonderful: immense, starry, where you even look at the shades of blue in the Milky Way (yes, they are not colors you see only in books!)... A sky without interruption of artificial lights for miles, surrounded by a silence that you never imagined could exist. A place to visit because it is one of the few places remaining natural on earth, innocent ... where children still accept a gift collecting it with open hands. Where children do not know what is a deflated balloon. Just to see their eyes lighting in discovering it, it's worth flying up to Mongolia!</p>

Mongolia is a fantastic destination because the scenery is just beautiful and the people are so friendly. Soyoloo was our tour guide and he spoke very good English, he was always punctual, very helpful and generally took care of us. He had very good knowledge of Mongolia, so we were well informed well of the history of Mongolia, the summer festival Nadaam, the traditional gers in the countryside, and the city of Ulaanbaatar. Visiting the traditional gers with Soyoloo was especially fun because We got to do so many different activities like try archery, try some of the Mongolian food, ride a camel, have our names written in Mongolian and we even had Mongolian music played to us. I had learnt that Mongolia is such a fascinating and unique country, which is extremely picturesque, and we would absolutely love to visit the country again in the future. I would recommend anyone thinking of going to Mongolia through Travel All Mongolia, to absolutely go, and get in contact with Soyoloo, because you will be well looked after and you will never forget the holiday.

<p>Naadam is the one and only Big Event in Mongolia –a lively national festival, held every year from the 11th – 13th July. Naadam means “three manly games”. Known as the world’s second-oldest Olympics, it celebrates what defined civilization in the Steppes eight centuries ago; archery, wrestling and horse riding. The competitors in the riding events are all children aged between five and twelve, many of whom have been in the saddle since the age of one. As they race along the plains for 20 kilometers, thousands of spectators line the remote track to watch up to 650 children sitting confidently astride their small but sturdy Mongolian steed. It is claimed that such equestrian skills won Genghis Khan an empire that stretched from the Sea of Japan all the way to Europe. In recent times, women have been allowed to enter and they now compete in two of the three events, horse racing and archery. Once a religious ceremony, the festival now formally commemorates the 1921 revolution when Mongolia declared itself a free country.</p>",

<br/>
I traveled with Travel All Mongolia in Mongolia in the summer of 2010. Mr. SoyolBayar, the owner and operator. He knows the landscape and the history behind the various locations that we toured as a group of six. Our tour guide understands his clients taste and is good at custom arranging tours according to the requests of the travelers in his entourage.</p>
<p>Our tour guide had everything well timed, and calling ahead he always had our arrival destination details ready and well prepared to accommodate us when we got to our location. The sights, the food, the reception, and the accommodations were excellent. His prices included everything; tickets to enter the shows, hotel accommodations, transport, food, and guided tours. I recommend Travel All Mongolia without reservation to anyone who wishes to visit Mongolia.</p>
<p>Mongolia is a beautiful country located in the Central Asian grasslands called the Steppes. It is a land-locked country, sandwiched between Russia and China. The wide open spaces and the friendliness of the people will leave you nostalgic for a land of extensive peacefulness and vastness, long after your visit. Mongolia is worth the visit, and Mongolian Journeys is your best bet at getting your money worth seeing this gorgeous land.</p>

While Kazakhs can be found in other countries, only Mongolian Kazakhs have preserved their unique culture and traditions such as eagle hunting.  The landscape is very different in this part of Mongolia.
<br>We'll visit the Gobi Desert where you'll be surprised to find that it is not at all as you may have imagined.  We'll see abundant wildlife in the Yolin Am Valley, search for dinosaur bones at the famous Flaming Cliffs, spend time with a camel herder family at the Khongor Sand Dunes, ride Bactrian camels, and enjoy climbing to the top of the Singing Dunes.
<br> We will continue on to the city of Kharkhorin, the center of Asia 800 years ago.  Although it lost its splendor long ago after enduring several battles, the former Buddhist religious center of Mongolia, Erdene Zuu Monastery, is a very interesting place to pay a visit.  The monastery was built using the bricks and stones of the ruins of the 13th century capital city.
<br>We then take you to Tsenkher Hot Spa in Arkhangai province where you can rest by soaking in a natural hot spa surrounded by forested mountains while having your favorite drinks and gazing at the millions of stars in the night sky.  This is also a good place to enjoy a relaxing ride on a horse.
<br>The final leg of your journey is Hustai National Park where wild Przewalski horses are successfully being reintroduced to Mongolia.  You will learn all about the horses as well as the other animals that inhabit the park.
<br>The whole tour will be an incredible experience that you will always cherish.  We will work with all our hearts to give you an enjoyable stay in our beautiful country, Mongolia.</p>",

If you choose, you can fly to Bayan-Ulgii province, the most western corner of Mongolia famous for its splendorous mountains and Kazakh eagle hunters. You visit and get introduced with Kazakh people lifestyle. This is a great opportunity for you to find out their eagle hunting while trying their delicious cuisine.
<br>Another fabulous destination is Khuvsgul Lake, which contains 3% of world fresh water, attracts both foreigners and locals throughout a whole year. This area is also a homeland to another extraordinary ethnic people, the reindeer herders. Therefore, this is a great chance for you to compare Kazakh hunters, reindeer herders and later on Mongolian nomads. All three have many similarities, yet unique in their own ways. Lake Khuvsgul is a beautiful spot for you to go hiking, horse trekking, boat sailing and simply walking on a peaceful shore surrounded by forested mountains. We also take you to a deer stone complex where you see the stelae from Bronze Age period but distinct from other deer stones found in elsewhere Mongolia.
<br>The next flight takes you to vast Gobi area where you continue to enjoy untouched steppes, mountains and grasslands namely along with its wild animals (if lucky) and domesticated ones such as Bactrian camels and many others. At Yolin Am gorge, we try to spot ibex and bearded vulture on our way to the ice that is kept the same fro the most time of a year, climb to Khongor Sand Dunes, and the biggest in Mongolia. Along the way we visit camel herders and get a glimpse of their daily house chores such as milking mares, and tending camels. If you wish to, you are always welcome to inquire about their lifestyle and husbandry, and ride a camel to the Dunes. One of the most exciting places in Gobi is definitely Flaming Cliffs that made Gobi known to the whole world due to the exploration of Roy Chapman Andrews. We can go on his trails and try to find dinosaur bones on our own. We offer you the best we have got and this unforgettable tour awaits you.</p>",

It diversifies into mountains and evergreen forest and geological freak shows - including a dune system as long and high as a mountain range - and sustains an array of endangered species that includes wild ass, wild camels and snow leopards.</p>
            <p>Every year during the first week of October, the “Eagle festival” is celebrated in Bayan Ulgii, in the far west of Mongolia. The aimag of Bayan Ulgii is situated in the breathtaking scenery of the Altai mountain range, where four Asian countries meet. The inhabitants of this area with its rich mix of cultures are mostly ethnic Kazakhs wearing their traditional embroidered clothes. </p>
            <p>The “Eagle festival” is a tournament of falconers from the region, who hunt with trained eagles. Once a year, they come together from their home village to measure their skills. There are about 380 falconers organized in an association. They are of all ages, from the teenage boy to the octogenarian, but in keeping with tradition, no girls or women may practice the art. </p>",

<p>While traveling around the Gobi, you will be thrilled by the contrasts between the Three Beauty Mountain Ranges, ice in the Eagle Valley which remains frozen until July, and sand dunes known as the &quot;singing dunes.&quot;</p>
<p>As you walk through Eagle Valley, enjoy observing and taking photos of pikas, the small, cute rodents that can be seen dragging grass into their burrows for winter consumption.</p>
<p>The Khongor Sand Dunes are a wonderful place to visit in the desert. If you ascend to the high sections of the dunes in the northwestern corner, you will have a chance to hear the sounds of the &quot;singing dunes.&quot; Slide off the dunes by kicking your legs and pushing your arms forward to hear their song!</p>
<p>We offer the opportunity to explore the Flaming Cliffs which were discovered by American explorer and naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews in the 1920s. The red sandstone cliffs are known by the name Bayanzag amongst the Mongols. Pieces of dinosaur bone are still being found at the Flaming Cliffs and other famous locations in the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p>The Mongolian Gobi is the only place where you can see two-humped Bactrian camels. A highlight of your tour will be experiencing the hospitality of a nomad family, making friends with camel herders, and learning more about their unique lifestyle.</p>
<p>Another fascinating part of this trip is Bayan-Ulgii Province, the home of the Kazakh people, located in the western part of Mongolia. Kazakhs have preserved their unique culture and traditions, such as eagle hunting, since ancient times. Knowledge of animal husbandry has been passed down from generation to generation and visitors will be impressed by the peoples&#39; hunting skills and horsemanship. The skillful Kazakh women will display their handmade embroideries which are unique works of art with beautiful patterns and colors. Don&rsquo;t miss viewing the untouched landscape which differs significantly with its splendid snow-capped mountains, wide valleys, pristine rivers, lakes, springs, and waterfalls as well as medicinal herbs, rare wild animals, and birds.</p>

        Your adventure ends with a visit to Hustai National Park where you have the opportunity to see Przewalski (Tahki) Horses. These endangered wild horses are native to the steppes of Mongolia. After becoming extinct in the wild in the 1960’s they were reintroduced to Hustai from a group of horses from several zoos in 1992. Today they roam freely through Hustai National Park, one of the best protected areas in Mongolia.</p>",

        <p>The Naadam festival means \"games\", also given the name \"eriin gurvan
        naadam\" meaning \"the three games of men\". These games are Mongolian
        wrestling, horse racing, and archery. The festival is held from July 11
        to the 13 at the National Sports Stadium. There is an elaborate ceremony
        before the games begin. During the festival, the wrestling really draws
        in the crowds. There is not any age or weight restriction, besides it
        being gender specific (no women are allowed compete). The objective is
        to pin your opponent to the ground with your elbow or knee, no part of
        the body is allowed to touch the ground besides your feet and hands. The
        winner is awarded the title of Avarga (Giant, or Titan). The horse
        racing event is very different from western horse racing as the races
        taking place are cross-country, and covering any distance between 10 to
        20 miles depending on the age of the horses. Up to 1000 horses can be
        chosen to participate. The jockeys are children between the ages of 5
        and 13, and training for the event begins many months in advance. The
        winning jockey is praised with the title of \"tumny ekh\" or \"leader of
        ten thousand\". The archery events are held between groups of ten men and
        women, and each participant is supplied with four arrows. There are
        hundreds of targets or \"surs\", and each team must hit at least 33 of
        them. The winners are declared the National Marksmen or National
        Markswomen. Some kind of version of these games have been going on for
        centuries.</p>",

Every time we turned a corner there was something new and different to experience.  Serjee was a wonderful guide; we enjoyed very much being with her.  She obviously loves Mongolia and was willing to share so much of herself (and her family) with us.  Visiting with her parents in their home was certainly a highlight. The drivers were the best.  We all felt very safe with them thru the mountains, rivers, whatever.  They participated in activities with us.  And even though they didn’t speak English we all communicated. Everything else was great.  This was one of the best trips I have ever taken. Thank you for offering it to us so we could see your wonderful country first hand.</p>
