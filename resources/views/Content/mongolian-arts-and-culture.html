    <h2>The Legend of the Horse Head Fiddle- Morin Khuur</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a handsome man in the Eastern part of Mongolia. He was known by the name “Khuhuu Namjil”. He also was popular among the locals as he sang beautifully. He  left for the western part of the country to serve in the army . His commander found him talented because he had a clear voice and sang beautifully. Instead of letting him do military training, his commander kept asking him to sing beautiful songs for him.  This went on for more than 3 years.  While he was in the army he met a beautiful princess. When he returned back home from the army, she gave him her horse named “Jonon Khar” as a token of remembrance. It was very a special horse. When he reached his home, locals were very interested in his horse. He only rode the horse given to him by his beloved princess. Locals also wondered why he only rode that horse.
        <br>In the evenings, he flew to the western part of the country on his horse to see his beloved princess but returned to the eastern part of the country at dawn Three years passed this way and nobody knew what he was doing. He had a neighbor who was very rich.  In that family, there also was a gossipy woman who let the people argue and quarrel with each other. She was very jealous of him since she knew that he had a very special horse that nobody else had.  She wanted to make trouble for him because of her jealousy. One time, Khukhuu Namjil saw his beloved princess and came back home as usual. His horse was sweating a lot and he wanted to send it to the pasture at dawn after its sweat had died down. He decided to relax until dawn.
        <br>As soon as the treacherous woman heard the sound of horse’s hooves, she spied upon them.  After Khukhuu Namjil went into his home, she approached the place where his horse was tied. Unfortunately, the horse didn’t sense that she was an enemy. The horse looked so splendid by showing its strong chest and it kept moving its wonderful two wings with magic. She hurried to her home and wanted to bring her scissors which she used to for tailoring work. The horse, which was commonly known by the name “Jonon Khar” died as the evil woman cut its beautiful magic wings.
        <br>Khukhuu Namjil woke up at dawn to send his horse to the pasture. But he found his beloved horse dead. He was in deep sorrow and was about to faint. His sorrow and loss couldn’t be expressed in words.
        <br>One day he decided to make a musical instrument for the remembrance of his beloved horse. He carved its head, made the handle from a soft tree and covered the lower part of that instrument with horse skin. The two strings were also made from the tail of his horse. He covered its two strings with tar to produce a more melodic sound. Then, he started playing it by describing different gates of his horse including galloping and trotting and also imitating its neighing. Thus, the Horse Head Fiddle “Morin Khuur” originated from Mongolia and the Mongols have played it for many centuries.</p>
