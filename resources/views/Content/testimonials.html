        <em>I'm doing well, and as far as sharing feedback about the FAM, and
            Mongolia, I had a fabulous time!  It was one of the best organized trips
            I've been on, our guide Bulgaa was excellent!  Any time, any one, had
            any questions or requests, she was there on the spot.  The experience of
            sleeping in gers was super!  Donna & I were able to upgrade to en suite
            at two locations, which was very convenient. Everything we saw and did
            was very educational and enjoyable.  The Ramada personnel were also
            great. I had a fabulous time.  Thank you for allowing me to participate!

        <em>Travel All Mongolia put on an excellent tour, well organized with
            comfortable vehicles, functional & comfortable Ger camps, and a very
            knowledgeable and personable guide whose love for her country shows.  We
            were well taken care of from the time we landed in UB until we departed
            UB. The itinerary brought us to numerous major landmarks in less than
            two weeks, although the fast pace did require significant travel time
            each day.  We truly enjoyed the Gobi, your beautiful & majestic national
            parks, eating local food, learning about your country’s religion,
            history and culture, meeting local nomadic families and learning about
            their way of life.  I highly recommend experiencing Mongolia through
            "Travel All Mongolia".</em></p>

        <em>I’ve been meaning to write to you and thank you for the wonderful trip to your magnificent country.  Every time we turned a corner there was something new and different to experience.  Serjee was a wonderful guide, we enjoyed very much being with her.  She obviously loves Mongolia and was willing to share so much of herself (and her family) with us.  Visiting with her parents in their home was certainly a highlight.  The drivers were the best.  We all felt very safe with them thru the mountains, rivers, whatever.  They participated in activities with us.  And even though they didn’t speak English we all communicated.  Everything else was great.  This was one of the best trips I have ever taken.  Thank you for offering it to us so we could see your wonderful country first hand.</em></p>

        through clients, friends, colleagues, etc., We enjoyed the gers; riding the
        camels and your guide Bulgaa is excellent.  We really appreciated having her
        tell us the stories about your country.  The drivers both did their best,
        very good to us and careful with the roads and we had such a wonderful time.

        <em>When you think about Mongolia, the first thing that comes to your mind is Genghis Khan, the tales of his achievements and the strength of his warriors. And then the desert, the Gobi, the dunes. A strange landscape that makes us running with imagination in geography books. Mongolia is much more: it is a country of dust, sounds, never-ending silence, and endless landscapes, horizons that seem to grow without end and without obstacles. Mongolia is reflected in people&#39;s eyes: peaceful, calm, always helpful and kind, fair &hellip; almost noble in their attitudes. People who live in gers (a name which will not say anything to most of Italian people) but that indicates typical tents where the nomadic Mongols lived and still live. Without continuous light, no running water, no comfort, no division of rooms and even less without bathroom. A tent where every day at any time you find a thermos full of hot water or airag (fermented milk, with a slightly salty taste and alcohol), ready for guests. A small cluster, a small world open to anyone who passes. No matter whom he is, where he comes from, what language he speaks. Just stop on the road (dusty way, sometimes there is not even a path and the driver moves like following an invisible line in the middle of the landscape). Someone will arrive in the saddle of his horse or riding a motorcycle. Probably it will be a child (they are entrusted to their family&rsquo;s herds) and he will immediately try to figure out how to help. Because you do not stop in the desert, if you do not really need to. You constantly travel, ride, go. And when you leave Ulaanbaatar (or UB, as they call it) you&rsquo;ll see just that: a long and vast prairie, always changing. Rockets, desert, dunes, mountains and plains. One day you are in t-shirt with 35 &deg; C. The day after you are obliged to wear gloves and scarf! Heaven and earth meet and touch (average altitude above sea level is from 1000 meters at least, UB is 1330 meters) ... in some places you believe you can touch the clouds. So it is not surprising to find out that one of the main deities is Tenger, the god of the sky. During night the sky is so beautiful and wonderful: immense, starry, where you even look at the shades of blue in the Milky Way (yes, they are not colors you see only in books!)... A sky without interruption of artificial lights for miles, surrounded by a silence that you never imagined could exist. A place to visit because it is one of the few places remaining natural on earth, innocent ... where children still accept a gift collecting it with open hands. Where children do not know what is a deflated balloon. Just to see their eyes lighting in discovering it, it&#39;s worth flying up to Mongolia!</em></p>

        <em>Hello Everybody</em></p>
    <p>
        <em>I traveled with Travel All Mongolia in Mongolia in the summer of 2010. Mr. SoyolBayar, the owner and operator. He knows the landscape and the history behind the various locations that we toured as a group of six. Our tour guide understands his clients taste and is good at custom arranging tours according to the requests of the travelers in his entourage.</em></p>

        <em>Our tour guide had everything well timed, and calling ahead he always had our arrival destination details ready and well prepared to accommodate us when we got to our location. The sights, the food, the reception, and the accommodations were excellent. His prices included everything; tickets to enter the shows, hotel accommodations, transport, food, and guided tours. I recommend Travel All Mongolia without reservation to anyone who wishes to visit Mongolia.</em></p>

        <em>Mongolia is a beautiful country located in the Central Asian grasslands called the Steppes. It is a land-locked country, sandwiched between Russia and China. The wide open spaces and the friendliness of the people will leave you nostalgic for a land of extensive peacefulness and vastness, long after your visit. Mongolia is worth the visit, and Mongolian Journeys is your best bet at getting your money worth seeing this gorgeous land.</em></p>

        <em>Hello,</em></p>
    <p>
        <em>I had a very enjoyable and unforgettable holiday in Mongolia, as it truly was the holiday of a lifetime. Mongolia is a fantastic destination because the scenery is just beautiful and the people are so friendly. Soyoloo was our tour guide and he spoke very good English, he was always punctual, very helpful and generally took care of us. He had very good knowledge of Mongolia, so we were well informed well of the history of Mongolia, the summer festival Nadaam, the traditional gers in the countryside, and the city of Ulaanbaatar. Visiting the traditional gers with Soyoloo was especially fun because We got to do so many different activities like try archery, try some of the Mongolian food, ride a camel, have our names written in Mongolian and we even had Mongolian music played to us. I had learnt that Mongolia is such a fascinating and unique country, which is extremely picturesque, and we would absolutely love to visit the country again in the future. I would recommend anyone thinking of going to Mongolia through Travel All Mongolia, to absolutely go, and get in contact with Soyoloo, because you will be well looked after and you will never forget the holiday.</em></p>
