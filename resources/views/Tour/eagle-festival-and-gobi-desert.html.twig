We loved visiting the Husai National Park and exploring the city of Ulaanbaatar.  Our favorite part of the trip was seeing the beautiful countryside and encountering wild horses, camels and eagles.
                                            Thank you so much for showing us around and making sure our trip was a success.  We also enjoyed our driver, Zoloo.  Look forward to planning our next adventure with you.

                                        the paleontological site known as the Flaming Cliffs. This captivating area,
                                        with rock formations and cliffs alight in oranges and golds was named by Roy
                                        Chapman Andrews, an American explorer who spent two years searching the Gobi
                                        Desert beginning in 1921. Over the course of his exploration he unearthed
                                        dinosaur fossils and eggs about 10-15 cm in size. It was the first discovery of

                                    <p>In the morning we drive to the site of the Khavtsgait Petroglyphs. The Khavtsgait
                                        Petroglyphs from the Bronze Age (4000-3000 BC) are beautifully carved on many
                                        rocks on the top of a sacred mountain. It is easy to find the rock paintings
                                        there because they are spread on rocks all around. The area is very rocky and
                                        can be slippery to climb, but by carefully following a path up the mountain, you
                                        can reach the top to see these beautiful rock paintings.</p>
                                    <p>The petroglyphs were carved and painted with motifs consisting of animals,
                                        hunting scenes and weapons. They depict various animals related to everyday life
                                        of ancient people including deer, bears, wolves and hunters, and wolves with
                                        livestock. Other paintings depict more domestic scenes of yaks pulling carts,
                                        the wheels and horses flattened sideways like hieroglyphs, and herders on
                                        horseback. The engravings vary in size, ranging from two-centimeters to the real
                                        life size of horses.</p>
                                    <p><em>Note: The area is very rocky and can be slippery to climb, but by wearing
                                            appropriate shoes and carefully following the mountain path one can reach

                                    <p>After the rest, we will visit a herder family nearby. We will spend some time
                                        there getting to know the family members and their casual yet unique daily
                                        lifestyle. It is a good chance to see how the family members cooperate together
                                        to do their daily even hourly chores such as milking mares, fencing and milking
                                        the goats. If you wish, you are welcome to try some mare's fermented milk and

                                        It became extinct in the wild in 1969 and, since 1992, has been successfully

                                    <p>The official opening ceremony commences with the participants parading in on
                                        horseback with their eagles. The competition begins with each Kazakh displaying
                                        his hunting outfit and accessories, the most elaborate and beautiful of which
                                        receive the highest points. In the afternoon, the judges will evaluate the
                                        Golden Eagles’ speed and agility. The eagles will be released from a cliff with
                                        their owners standing below, signaling for the eagles to land upon their arms as
                                        they do while hunting. Those with the fastest times and best technique will be
                                        awarded the highest scores. In the evening, attend a Kazakh play in honor of the
                                        hunters and their eagles.</p>

                                        dragged by their owner on horseback. The eagles will be judged on their success
                                        of grabbing the "fox", their speed, and "gripping" technique. As the points for
                                        the competitions are being tallied, the Kazakhs will compete in their
                                        traditional game called "kukbar"- passing goat skin which tests one's horse
                                        riding skills, strength and agility. In the late afternoon, the winners of the

                                    <p>We will be visiting some of the nomads of the area and experiencing their unique
                                        lifestyle. Kazakh craftswomen are renowned for their colorful embroidery and
                                        textiles, and their gers are beautifully decorated. Handcrafted felt carpets
                                        line the floor, and delicately embroidered tapestries adorn the walls of their
                                        homes, with each design unique to a particular family. After meeting a Kazakh,
                                        you will be impressed by the generous hospitality expressed through expansive
                                        meals with many dishes and countless cups of milk tea and sweets. The herder
                                        will also demonstrate his horsemanship and training techniques which have been
                                        passed down from generation to generation. The ger will be decorated with
                                        beautiful embroideries which are handmade by the skillful Kazakh women. The
                                        embroideries are truly works of art and display fine workmanship with beautiful
                                        colors and patterns.</p>
