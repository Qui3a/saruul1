We loved visiting the Husai National Park and exploring the city of Ulaanbaatar.  Our favorite part of the trip was seeing the beautiful countryside and encountering wild horses, camels and eagles.
                                            Thank you so much for showing us around and making sure our trip was a success.  We also enjoyed our driver, Zoloo.  Look forward to planning our next adventure with you.
