                                            during our trip to Mongolia. We loved visiting the Husai National Park and
                                            exploring the city of Ulaanbaatar. Our favorite part of the trip was seeing
                                            the beautiful countryside and encountering wild horses, camels and eagles.
                                            Thank you so much for showing us around and making sure our trip was a
                                            success. We also enjoyed our driver, Zoloo. Look forward to planning our
                                            next adventure with you.

                                    <p>Today we will drive to Hustai National Park, which is world famous for the
                                        successful reintroduction of the Przewalski horse, called "takhi" by Mongolians.
                                        It became extinct in the wild in 1969 and, since 1992, has been successfully
                                        reintroduced to Hustai from zoos around the world. This has been an
                                        international effort monitored by The Foundation for the Przewalski horse, based
                                        in the Netherlands and MACNE (Mongolian Association for Conservation of Nature
                                        and the Environment).
                                        <br>Upon arrival in Hustai, you will check in at our ger camp. After lunch, you
                                        will take a jeep ride into the park. The national park is comprised of rolling
                                        Steppe Mountains with rather large patches of birch and aspen forests. There are
                                        also visible remains of Neolithic graves. In addition, red deer and wolf have
                                        increased quite a bit during the last few years, as well as Mongolian gazelle.
                                        Species present in Hustai but usually not seen include Lynx, Argali Sheep and
                                        Roe Deer. Usually, you are able to see the herds of wild horses grazing in the
                                        grasslands of the parks and other wild animals.</p>

                                        Kharahhorin or Harhorin), the symbolic ruins of the 13th century capital of the
                                        Mongol Empire. The ancient capital of Mongolia, Karakorum, was located on the
                                        right bank of Orkhon River and on the northeastern slopes of the Khangai
                                        Mountains. Founded by Chinggis Khan in 1220, it was not only the capital of the
                                        vast Mongolian Empire, but also the epicenter of trade along the Silk Road. At
                                        that time the inhabitants of city were mostly merchant craftsmen who came to
                                        Karakorum from all over the world. In 1379 much of the city was badly damaged
                                        during an attack by the army of the Min Dynasty.
                                        <br><strong>Erdene Zuu monastery</strong>
                                        <br>Erdene Zuu monastery was built by Avtai Sain Khan on the ruins of the
                                        Mongolian capital Karakorum in 1586. It was the first great Buddhist Monastery
                                        of Mongolia. It is part of the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape UNESCO World
                                        Heritage site. Stones from the ruins of Karakorum were used in construction, and
                                        it is surrounded by a wall featuring 108 stupas, 108 being a sacred number in
                                        Buddhism, and the number of beads in a Buddhist rosary. The monastery was
                                        damaged by warfare in the 1680s, but was rebuilt in the 18th century and by 1872
                                        had a full 62 temples inside. The Erdene Zuu Monastery was taken under state
                                        protection and became a museum in 1944.

                                        like hieroglyphs, and herders on horseback. The engravings vary in size, ranging
