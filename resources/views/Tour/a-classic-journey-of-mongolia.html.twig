We loved visiting the Husai National Park and exploring the city of Ulaanbaatar.  Our favorite part of the trip was seeing the beautiful countryside and encountering wild horses, camels and eagles.
                                            Thank you so much for showing us around and making sure our trip was a success.  We also enjoyed our driver, Zoloo.  Look forward to planning our next adventure with you.

                                        can reach the top to see these beautiful rock paintings.
                                        <br> The petroglyphs were carved and painted with motifs consisting of animals,
                                        hunting scenes and weapons. They depict various animals related to everyday life

                                        livestock. Other paintings depict more domestic scenes of yaks pulling carts,

                                        <br> After the rest, we will visit a herder family nearby. We will spend some
                                        time there getting to know the family members and their casual yet unique daily
                                        lifestyle. It is a good chance to see how the family members cooperate together

                                        sacred number in Buddhism, and the number of beads in a Buddhist rosary. The
                                        monastery was damaged by warfare in the 1680s, but was rebuilt in the 18th
                                        century and by 1872 had a full 62 temples inside. The Erdene Zuu Monastery was
                                        taken to state protection and became museum in 1944.
